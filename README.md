FBI Unified Crime Data Scraper :chart_with_upwards_trend:
============

The FBI releases Unified Crime Data that shows crime stats broken down by city.
Unfortunately, it is only available as an HTML table. Even data.gov just links to the table.

This is focusing on "Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by State by City"

This is a basic scraper to create CSV files, broken down by year and state.
